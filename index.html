  <div class="introduction">
    <p class="first_para">
      By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
      his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
      including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and
      NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug
      costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It’s the most aggressive
      action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower the
      deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair
      share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a penny more
      in taxes.
    </p>
    <p class="second_para ">
      President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
      interests to pass this historic legislation that lowers costs for
      Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
      building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and
      the middle out.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="first-section">
    <h2 class="heading">LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</h2>
    <p class="third_para">
      The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs,
      including prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance coverage
      for AA and NHPI families.
    </p>

    <p class="fourth_para">
      <span class="dark">Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors: </span> Americans pay 2-3 times more
      for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries.
      Nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs, and high
      prices contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities. The Inflation
      Reduction Act will help close the gap in access to medication by
      improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug prices in
      Medicare. The law:
    </p>

    <ul class="points">
      <li class="internal_points">
        Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
        they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to
        seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
        thousands more on prescription drugs.
      </li>

      <li class="internal_points"> 
        Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a
        month’s supply.

        shingles vaccine, for Medicare beneficiaries.

  <div class="second-section">
    <h2 class="heading">MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</h2>

    <p class="third_para">
      President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an
      unfair tax system worse. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a
      critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
      revenue by:
    </p>

    <ul class="points">
      <li class="internal_points">
        Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the taxes
        they already owe.
      </li>

      <li class="internal_points">
        Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
        away with paying no federal income tax.
      </li>

      <li class="internal_points">
        Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will
        encourage businesses to invest
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="first_para">
      The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance
      critically needed investments to lower costs and combat climate change,
      they are also an important component of building an economy that rewards
      work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away
      with playing by a separate set of rules.
    </p>

    <p class="first_para">
      Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits
      they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get their
      questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
      transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no
      family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up by
      a single cent.
